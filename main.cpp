Project 3 - Part 1a-d / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Create a branch named Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you 
writing C++ code that compiles and to reinforce the syntax habits 
that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of 
Project 5 in C++ Language Fundamentals.

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write User-Defined Types (UDTs)

You are going to write 10 UDTs in project3.  
Part1 will be broken up into 5 separate steps, all on the same branch.
    Part 1a: you will learn to think about an object in terms of 
    its sub-objects.
    
    Part 1b: you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english.
    
    Part 1c: you will write 1 UDT in plain english that will be 
    made of 5 related sub-objects.
    
    Part 1d: you will write plain-english UDTs for the 5 
    sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c.
    
    Part 1e: you will convert those 10 plain-english UDTs into code 
    that runs.

/*
Part 1b - Lesson
Now you have some basic understanding of how to think of an object 
in terms of its sub-objects.

Next, write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english:
*/
/*
 example:  
 
Thing: Car Wash   
    5 properties:
        - number of vacuum cleaners
        - number of eco-friendly cleaning supplies
        - the amount of water used per week.
        - amount of profit made per week
        - number of cars serviced per day
    3 things it can do:
        - wash and wax car
        - charge customer
        - detail the car interior

    Notice that I did not use "has a vacuum cleaner" or "Has 
    eco-friendly cleaning supplies" as one of the properties.
    
    Writing 'has a ___" checks whether or not your object **has the 
    ability to do something**.
    Instead, I wrote "number of vacuum cleaners" and "number of 
    eco-friendly cleaning supplies".  
    
    These are specific objects or amounts. 
    
    In C++ terms, this means to I want you to avoid using 'bool' 
    (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types.

    In addition to the usual primitives (covered in Project 2), you 
    can use 'std::string' to represent strings in this project.

===================
Part 1b Assignment: 1 Step
===================
1)  Fill in the 4 UDTs below with a random UDT in plain english.
    These 4 UDTs do not need to be related.
        a) For each plain-english UDT, write out 5 traits or 
        properties and 3 things it can do.
        b) remember: these properties will eventually become
        primitives.
        c) pick properties that can eventually be represented with 
        'int float double bool char std::string'.

 /*
Part 1c - Lesson
You have just finished practicing writing out a UDT that is has 
5 properties and can perform 3 actions.  

Now you will write 1 UDT in plain english. 

This UDT will be different than the previous 4 you wrote: It will 
use UDTs to describe its 5 properties, as opposed to using C++ 
primitives to describe the 5 properties.

You will define these 5 'property' UDTs in Part 1d.
 */

 /*
Part 1c example:
    Cell Phone

    A Cell Phone is built using the following 5 UDTs:
        Display
        Memory
        CPU
        Radio
        Applications

    A Cell Phone has 3 things it can do:
        make a call
        send a text
        run an application.

    Notice that I did not use "has a display" or "Has memory" or 
    "has a cpu" as one of the properties of the CellPhone.
    
    Writing 'has a ___" checks whether or not your object **has 
    the ability to do something**.
    Instead, I wrote "Display" or "CPU".  These are specific 
    objects or amounts. 
    
    In C++ terms, this means to I want you to avoid using 'bool' 
    (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types.

    When you choose your 5 smaller parts, remember that each of 
    these 5 Sub Objects will need to be defined with 5 primitive 
    properties and 3 actions EACH.
*/
/*
===================
Part 1c assignment: 2 steps
===================

1) write the name of the primitive type you'll be using after each 
    property in UDTs 1-4 from Part 1b:
    pick properties that can be represented with 
    'int float double bool char std::string'.
    example: 
        Display:
            Number of Pixels (int)
            Amount of Power consumed (milliwatt-hours) (float)
            Brightness (double)
            area in cm2 (int)
            brand (std::string)

2) Fill in the 10th UDT below.
Define an object that is made of 5 sub-objects.
    These 5 sub-objects will not be defined using Primitives, but instead will be their own UDTs 
    you'll define these 5 sub-objects in Part 1d.

/*

    1)
    2)
    3)
    4)
    5)

    1)
    2)
    3)
 */

/*
Part 1d - Lesson
You now know how to define a UDT that is composed of other UDT.
Now you will learn how to break down those sub-object UDTs into 
their 5 properties and 3 actions.

The goal of Part 1d is to get you to think about breaking down an 
object into smaller and smaller objects, until the smallest object 
is made of up only C++ primitives and std::string. 

Revisiting the previous example:  
Cell Phone

A Cell Phone is made up of the following 5 properties/sub-objects 
and 3 actions:
    Display
    Memory
    CPU
    Radio
    Applications
3 actions:
    make a call
    send a text
    run an application.

These 5 properties can be broken down into their own sub-objects 
and properties. 

If we break down the first property 'Display' into its 5 properties 
we get:
    brightness
    amount of power consumed.
    pixels
    width in cm
    height in cm

the Display's brightness can be represented with a Primitive, 
such as a double. 

The amount of power consumed can also be represented with a 
Primitive, such as a float or integer (i.e. 250mWa)

The 'pixels' property must be represented with an array of Pixel 
instances, as the screen has more than 1 row of pixels.
    Arrays have not been discussed and can't be used in this 
    project.
    Instead, we can use an Integer primitive to store the 
    Number of Pixels:

Display:
    Number of Pixels
    Amount of Power consumed (milliwatt-hours)
    Brightness
    width in cm
    height in cm

As you can see, the 'Display' UDT has been broken down to the 
point of being able to describe it with C++ primitives. 
*/

/*
===================
Part 1d assignment: 3 Parts.
===================

1) Fill in #5 - #9 below with plain-english UDTs for the 5 
properties you created for UDT #10. 
    example: 
        If #10's first property was 'Engine', then `Thing 5)` 
        will be `Engine`. 
        You will need to provide 5 properties and 3 member 
        functions of that Engine object in plain English.
        Remember to pick properties that can be represented 
        with 'int float double bool char std::string'.

2) write the name of the primitive type you'll be using after 
each property for UDTs 5 - 9.
    You already did this for UDTs 1-4 in Part 1c.
    Pick properties that can be represented with 
    'int float double bool char std::string'
    example: 
        Display:
            Number of Pixels (int)
            Amount of Power consumed (milliwatt-hours) (float)
            Brightness (double)
            width in cm (int)
            height in cm (int)

Step 3 is written below UDTs 5 - 9
